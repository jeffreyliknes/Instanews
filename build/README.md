Instanews API assignment 

This is assignment is a focus on using AJAX to get news articles and using JQuery to properly display them.

API was created using top stories from New York Times "https://api.nytimes.com/svc/topstories/v2/".

This website used Javascript/JQuery and AJAX
as well as SCSS and HTML. Starting with mobile-first then using responsive layout techniques for tablet and desktop viewing.


I used GULP to help find errors by linting and reloading browsers.
